# 🔧 Image Upload Troubleshooting & Fix

## Problem
Image upload not working when adding or updating labor records.

## Solution

### Step 1: Create/Verify Storage Bucket via SQL

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. **Run this SQL script**:

```sql
-- Ensure bucket exists and is public
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('id_images', 'id_images', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true WHERE id = 'id_images';

SELECT id, name, public FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'id_images';
```

3. **Expected output**: Should show `id_images | id_images | true`

### Step 2: Configure Policies via Dashboard (Important!)

Since RLS policies must be set through the Supabase Dashboard, do this:

1. **Go to Storage → Buckets → id_images**
2. **Click "Policies" tab**
3. **Make sure these 3 policies exist:**

#### Policy 1: Public READ
- Click "New policy" → "Create a policy from a template"
- Select: "Enable public access"
- This allows anyone to read/download files

#### Policy 2: Authenticated UPLOAD
- Click "New policy" → "For INSERT" → "As Authenticated User"
- Click "Add policy"
- This allows logged-in users to upload files

#### Policy 3: Authenticated DELETE
- Click "New policy" → "For DELETE" → "As Authenticated User"
- Click "Add policy"
- This allows logged-in users to delete their files

**OR if policies don't auto-create**, manually create them:

**Click "+ New Policy"** and create:

```
Policy Name: "Public Read"
Operation: SELECT (Read)
Target Role: Authenticated and Anonymous
With Expression: Leave blank (or use: (bucket_id = 'id_images'))
```

```
Policy Name: "Authenticated Upload"
Operation: INSERT (Create)
Target Role: Authenticated
With Expression: Leave blank (or use: (bucket_id = 'id_images'))
```

```
Policy Name: "Authenticated Delete"
Operation: DELETE (Delete)
Target Role: Authenticated
With Expression: Leave blank (or use: (bucket_id = 'id_images'))
```

### Step 3: Verify Bucket Settings

Go to **Storage → Buckets**:
- ✅ Bucket name: `id_images`
- ✅ Visibility: **Public** (toggle should be ON)
- ✅ File size limit: At least 5 MB
- ✅ Check "Policies" tab - should show at least 1 policy

### Step 4: Test the Upload

1. **Go to Management page**
2. **Click "إضافة موظف جديد"** (Add new employee)
3. **Fill the form:**
   - Select business from dropdown
   - Enter employee name
   - Enter national ID
   - Enter salary
4. **Select an image file**
5. **Click "رفع الصورة"** (Upload image button)
6. Should see: **"✓ تم رفع الصورة بنجاح"** (Image uploaded successfully)
7. **Click "حفظ"** (Save button)
8. Should redirect to management page

### Step 4: Test Editing

1. **Go to Management page**
2. **Find a labor record and click "تعديل"** (Edit)
3. **Form loads with existing data**
4. **To add/change image:**
   - Select new image file
   - Click "رفع الصورة" button
   - Wait for success message
   - Click "حفظ" (Save)
5. Should update successfully

## What Changed

### Updated Files
1. **create-storage-bucket.sql** - New RLS policies (simpler, more permissive)
2. **labor-form.html** - Improved upload function with better error handling

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Simpler File Paths
```
BEFORE: {userID}/{laborId}/timestamp.jpg
NOW:    labor_timestamp_random.jpg
```
- Easier to work with
- Avoids nested folder issues
- No RLS path matching needed

#### 2. Better RLS Policies
```sql
-- Now uses authenticated role check instead of complex path matching
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload ID images"
    ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        bucket_id = 'id_images'
        AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    );
```

#### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages in console
- Shows specific error to user
- Checks if file is selected before upload
- Validates file type and size
- Waits for upload completion before showing URL

#### 4. Fixed Edit Mode
- When editing, you can now add/replace images
- Old image URL kept if you don't upload new image
- Clear warning if file selected but not uploaded

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run the SQL script in Supabase
- [ ] Verify bucket exists and is public
- [ ] Test adding new labor record with image
- [ ] Test adding new labor record without image
- [ ] Test editing labor record and replacing image
- [ ] Test editing labor record without changing image
- [ ] Check image displays in management page (عرض الصورة link)
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting upload error?

**Check 1: Bucket exists and is public**
```
Go to Storage → Buckets
Look for "id_images"
Make sure visibility is "Public"
```

**Check 2: Run the SQL script**
```
Open Supabase SQL Editor
Copy entire create-storage-bucket.sql content
Run it
Check for errors
```

**Check 3: Check browser console**
- Open browser F12 Developer Tools
- Click "Console" tab
- Try uploading image
- Look for error messages
- Share the error with exact text

**Check 4: Check user authentication**
- Make sure you're logged in as a company user
- Check user role is "company"
- Verify auth token is valid

### Image not displaying?

- Check image URL in database (query labor_records table)
- Copy URL and open in new tab
- Should display the image
- If not, file may not have uploaded to storage

### Getting "유效な파일" error?

- Make sure file is actual image (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Not a corrupted file
- File size less than 5MB
- Check file extension

## File Locations

**Database:**
- Table: `labor_records`
- Column: `id_image_url`
- Stores: Public URL of uploaded image

**Storage:**
- Bucket: `Storage → id_images`
- Files: `labor_timestamp_random.jpg`
- Public URL: `https://yourstorage.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/id_images/labor_*.jpg`
