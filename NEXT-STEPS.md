# 🎯 OFOQ System - Next Steps

## ✅ What's Working Now:
- ✅ Admin login working
- ✅ Admin dashboard functional
- ✅ Company creation working
- ✅ Service activation system in place
- ✅ Database tables created
- ✅ Management.html fixed (no more CORS errors)

## 🔧 Current Issue:
Company users can't login because their emails aren't confirmed.

## 📝 Fix Steps:

### 1. Confirm Company Emails
Execute this SQL in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
UPDATE auth.users 
SET email_confirmed_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'test@gmail.com' 
AND email_confirmed_at IS NULL;
```

### 2. Deploy Latest Changes
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ZoomStore\Desktop\oufq"
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Update all pages to use CDN Supabase - fixes CORS errors"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test Company Login
1. Go to: https://oufq.vercel.app/login.html
2. Login with: `test@gmail.com` / `[your password]`
3. Should redirect to company dashboard
4. Only enabled services should show

## 🚀 Future Enhancement:
Update admin dashboard to auto-confirm emails when creating companies.

## 📋 Current System Status:

### Database Tables:
- ✅ user_profiles (with RLS disabled for testing)
- ✅ services (4 services: hr, inventory, sales, invoices)
- ✅ company_services (tracks activated services)

### Authentication:
- ✅ Admin: admin@ofoq.com
- ✅ Company: test@gmail.com (needs email confirmation)

### Pages Working:
- ✅ login.html (CDN Supabase)
- ✅ admin-dashboard.html (needs CDN update)
- ✅ management.html (CDN updated)
- ⏳ dashboard.html (needs CDN update)
- ⏳ financial.html (needs CDN update)

## 🎯 Next Phase:
After company login works, we need to:
1. Update dashboard.html and financial.html to use CDN
2. Re-enable RLS policies properly
3. Build actual HR and financial data entry forms
4. Add real data storage (not just demo tables)
